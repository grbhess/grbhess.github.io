<br><font size="+1">Summary</font></br>
<br id="explanation">
The above table summarizes H.E.S.S. GRB observations since the most recent camera upgrade in late 2019. It includes <i>completed</i> observations as well as <i>planned</i> ones. 
<b>Please note that planned observations are subject to external effects such as weather conditions and technical difficulties, as well as burst advocate decisions, and are not guaranteed.</b>
In general, the H.E.S.S. burst advocate who is on call for a particular GRB will modify the table the morning after observations have been taken;
after this point, the table elements will reflect the actual observations and not the planned ones.
</br>
<br>
The current H.E.S.S. GRB observation policy is to observe all well-localized GRBs that can be observed within 24 hours of the GRB trigger time,
for the entirety of the observable window on the first night.
H.E.S.S. also observes a subset of GRBs with larger localization uncertainties using a tiled observing pattern.
We observe around 20-25 GRBs per year, of which roughly three quarters are observed with pointed observations and a quarter with tiled observations.
In general, a small fraction of GRBs that pass our observing criteria are never observed due to burst advocate decision.
Possible reasons are: The delay time is long and the observable window is short; the GRB notice was later retracted; the GRB was determined to be at a large redshift.

<ul>
    <li><b>GRB ID</b>: GRB identifier from the triggering instrument (derived from automated notices) and/or the full alphanumeric name where applicable (manually entered)</li>
    <li><b>Triggering instrument</b>: The GRB detector whose notification triggered H.E.S.S.; this is usually the detector with the best available localization at the time of the H.E.S.S. observations</li>
    <li><b>Alert time (T0)</b>: Trigger time of the GRB, for the triggering instrument, in UTC</li>
    <li><b>GRB RA (J2000), GRB Dec (J2000)</b>: Localization of the GRB by the triggering instrument, right ascension and declination, in both degrees and hms/dms. For <b>tiled observations</b>, this is the position of the <i>first</i> tile that H.E.S.S. observed or plans on observing.</li>
    <li><b>H.E.S.S. window start, H.E.S.S. window end</b>: Either: The start and end of the time period when the GRB is visible to H.E.S.S. (usually below 60&#176; zenith angle, sometimes below 45&#176;) OR the start and end of the time period during which H.E.S.S. observed the GRB</li>
    <li><b>Obs mode</b>: H.E.S.S. observation mode, either Pointed (for all well-localized GRBs) or Tiled (for GRBs with larger localization regions)</li>
    <li><b>Reaction</b>: H.E.S.S. array reaction mode, either Automatic (for GRBs with very short observation delays) or Manual</li>
    <li><b>Contact</b>: The name of the H.E.S.S. burst advocate for this GRB</li>
