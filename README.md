# GRB H.E.S.S. Dashboard (GitHub Pages)

This repository hosts the **public, static** GRB dashboard for H.E.S.S., published via **GitHub Pages** (branch `gh-pages`).  
The actual build and publication are performed by a **GitLab CI pipeline** that is triggered automatically when the GRB observation table (`obstable.csv`) is updated.

GitLab page: https://gitlab.in2p3.fr/hess/softwaremodules/highleveltools/hess-grb-dashboard/

## What’s in this repo

- ['Main'] `obstable.csv`  
  The input table maintained in this GitHub repository. Updating this file is what triggers the rebuild.

- ['Main'] `.github/workflows/...`  
  A GitHub Actions workflow that triggers the GitLab pipeline when `obstable.csv` changes.

- [gh-pages] `index.html`  
  The generated public dashboard page published by GitHub Pages.  
  **Do not edit this file manually** — it is overwritten by automation.

- [gh-pages] `docs.html`  
  Documentation page for the public version of the dashboard. Can be edited/replaced if new documentation needs to be done

## How it works

1. You or the VoSystem pushes changes to `obstable.csv` on the `main` branch.
2. GitHub Actions triggers a GitLab pipeline (via GitLab “pipeline trigger” API).
3. The GitLab pipeline:
   - fetches `obstable.csv` from this repo at the exact commit SHA,
   - rebuilds the merged database and dashboards,
   - publishes:
     - a **public** dashboard to this repo’s `gh-pages` branch as `index.html`,
     - a **private** dashboard to GitLab Pages (not hosted here).

## Updating the public dashboard

Just edit and commit:

- `obstable.csv` (in the repo root)
